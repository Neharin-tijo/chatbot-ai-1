Home/TEDxSJCETPalai TEDxSJCETPalaiSoftware Development Center2025-02-18T10:37:56+00:00What is TED? TED is a non-profit organization with the spirit of promoting ideas that deserve to be scattered. Beginning with a four-day conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support ideas that change the world through multiple initiatives. At TED, thinkers and filmmakers around the world are invited to give the best speech of their lives in 18 minutes. These presentations are made available for free on the TED.com website. What is TEDx? Unlike TED itself, which hosts annual global conferences, TEDx events are local and community-driven, allowing for a wide range of topics, from technology and entertainment to education, personal development, and social issues. Each TEDx event follows guidelines set by TED but has its own unique theme and speakers, making every event distinct and relevant to its specific audience. Excellence Beyond Notice 2025 The event aimed to shed light on the often-overlooked contributions and efforts that lead to extraordinary achievements. The event featured a diverse lineup of speakers who shared their unique insights and experiences, inspiring the audience to recognize and pursue excellence in various fields. TEDxSJCETPalai 2025 – Excellence Beyond Notice On February 8, 2025, St. Joseph’s College of Engineering and Technology, Palai, hosted TEDxSJCETPalai under the theme “Excellence Beyond Notice.” This independently organized TEDx event brought together a diverse group of thought leaders, innovators, and visionaries to explore the often-overlooked efforts that drive extraordinary achievements. The event opened with an address by Rev. Fr. Mathew Koramkuzha, followed by a rulebook presentation by Mr. Jithin Jaison. A distinguished lineup of speakers, including Mr. Sabarinath G. Pillai (Cybersecurity Evangelist), Mr. Advin Roy Netto (UX Designer at Google), Mr. Vishnu Narayanan B. (Head-Talent Development, TCS Kerala), Ms. Amina Nijam (Actress), and Ms. Anna Susan Roy (Miss Kerala 2021 Finalist), delivered thought-provoking talks, sparking meaningful conversations. Beyond the speaker sessions, the event featured interactive discussions, networking opportunities, and artistic performances, enriching the experience for all attendees. The day concluded with a vote of thanks by Ms. Devanandana A. Nair, a reflection session, and certificate distribution to speakers and volunteers. TEDxSJCETPalai 2025 was a resounding success, igniting inspiration, fostering innovation and community engagement, and staying true to the spirit of TEDx—spreading ideas that matter. Discover Rediscover 2022 From one moment to another, memory steps back to rediscover the past and comprehend the meaning or define its true colors. If we are to go forward, we must go back to discover and rediscover certain elements that hinge on our foundations. Our theme hence, brings light on the need to explore and discuss ideas from different and novel perspectives. TEDxSJCETPalai is also about a gentle reminder; to always rediscover one another because we are forever changing. Ellipsis 2018 Ellipsis is used to define an unfinished thought about an object or a person, or a certain idea about either of them. It pushes us to concentrate deeply on our unfinished thoughts and take required actions to obtain a fruitful outcome. Connecting people to reflect and transform each other is one of the great purposes of this first edition of TEDxSJCETPalai. TEDxSJCETPalai will be a celebration of individuality. We hope to bring together some of the most distinguished individuals from our local community to share, inspire and demonstrate the power of original ideas. We want each person to walk out with an unforgettable experience and undying urge to bring out the spark of originality that lies within each one of us.

He is the current president of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations (FIRA). He founded the Dakshina Kannada Rationalist Association and has been its secretary since then. He also found an NGO called Aid Without Religion. SAJI THOMAS Mr. Saji Thomas Not being able to hear and speak since birth, Saji Thomas shot to fame for creating a light-weight aircraft. It was called the X-Air-S and its total cost amounted to only Rs. 14 Lakh, making it one of the cheapest aircrafts to be invented. He received the guidance of SKJ Nair, retired wing commander , Indian Air Force, during the final stages of completion. Mr. Saji was denied education at Grade 7 due to his inquisitiveness to disassemble every electronic equipment he found. He is now a record holder in the Indian Book of Record Holders as India’s first differently abled person to build an aircraft which then featured him on the Discovery channel programme entitled HRX Superheroes. His life has also been featured in movies like Aby and Vimanam. *Do not miss this exclusive talk!* Only at #tedxsjcetpalai SANA KHADER At the age of 9, she started following her dream of doing something creative by designing dresses.

Your counsellor can work with you to help you make decisions and changes that may work better for you.

As the technology rests on the firm foundation of science, Chemistry is an excellent way to help technical students to understand the relationship between science and technology. Experimental work plays a very important role in it. Chemistry Lab in in our college is well equipped to design and execute the experiments and interpret the results obtained henceforth. The Chemistry Lab which caters to the needs of First year B.Tech students has equipment’s for conducting the experiments of the course and also the interdisciplinary projects. Presently Chemistry lab accommodates the objective of better understanding of syllabus of 1st year B.Tech and absorbs the theory along with implementing it practically. Chemistry lab can presently accommodate 30 students working at the same time in a session. Students conduct experiment in a group of two to learn team work and help each other for the same. The titrations are conducted individually by the student. Engineering Chemistry Lab incorporates the experiments which involve the volumetric estimation of chemicals, estimation of ores, preparation of polymers and determination of various properties of water samples. This lab comprises of the sophisticated instruments like colourimeter, Conductivity meter, pH meter, Flame Photometer, and Spectrophotometer etc. along with the other relevant glass wares, reagents and materials to be studied. Well prepared laboratory manuals for all experiments facilitate easy reference and aid students to execute the experiments. Lab is operational daily for 4 hours, during which one faculty member and two lab instructors are present for guidance. Well observed activity time and strict discipline is adhered to ensuring quality work and safety of both personnel and equipment. Engineering Physics Lab Experimental work involves measurement and analysis of various data to verify the laws and principles of different branches of Physics. Laboratory work plays a significant role in the development of the ability of observation, logical analysis of results and analytical skill of students. The experiments in Engineering Physics are designed to impact practical knowledge about some of the phenomena that the students have learnt in Engineering Physics course and to enhance the experimental skills of students. The main objective is learning by doing. The students are given exposure to a number of measuring instruments in various areas of Physics and Engineering. A well-equipped Physics lab which can accommodate a batch of 30 students provides ample facilities for performing experiments both individually and as a team. The lab has sophisticated measuring instruments such as CRO, He-Ne laser source, Spectrometer, Polari meter, Newton’s Rings Apparels etc. Laboratory manual which describes the theoretical background and methodology of experimental observation provides guidance to students in the lab performance. Members of faculty and lab instructions ensure good discipline in the lab and proper handling of the apparatus. X"

Tech in Electronics and Computer Engineering (ES) is a four-year professional undergraduate program was established in the year 2021 with an annual intake of 60 students. Electronics and Computer Engineering is an integrated program, which particularly focuses on imparting skills in electronics hardware, software and IT, as required by the industry. The curriculum is organized in such a way that it enables students to build a solid foundation in various aspects of Electronic Circuits, Digital System Design, VLSI Design, Embedded Systems & IoT, Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming, Computer Networks, Database management Systems, etc. Merging the two disciplines will offer a magnificent foundation in both subject areas and will prepare aspirants to a wide range of careers, in both or either of the fields. This cross-discipline study will aid in molding a multi-skilled professional engineer with meticulous understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques from these areas, opening path to establish an exceptional professional career. VISION MISSION VISION Develop into a centre of excellence in Electronics and Computer Engineering by producing technically competent professionals catering to the needs for Industry, Academia and Society.

PSO PSO1: Ability to apply fundamental knowledge in Electronics and Computer Engineering to analyse and design hardware and software systems so as to understand and solve engineering problems. PSO2: Ability to communicate technical information in both oral and written formats effectively. CO-PO Mapping CO-PO Mapping INITIATIVES BEYOND THE CLASS ROOM Mentor System Each faculty member in the department is assigned the complete responsibility of 30 students. This Faculty Mentor establishes a close relationship with students, orients them to college practices, follows their progress regularly and guides them throughout the four-year course. Employment of this idea has helped several students to solve the problems they face in the academics. Also this method helps the parents to keep track of their child and their academic performance. Remedial Education The students with backlogs have a heavy load as they must take exams simultaneously for both the new semester’s subjects as well as for the subjects they fail; and they cannot attend classes in the subjects they have failed. Thus, they do not get any additional teaching in the subjects in which they are weak unless they resort to coaching classes or other private means. This may in turn result in cumulative failures, leading some students to take more years to complete the four-year engineering course. To help our students from such situations, remedial classes are provided by the ES department during the month before the repeat exams, enabling the students to face the difficult papers with greater confidence and ease. Placement Training Department offers intense placement training on regular basis. LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Learning Management System (LMS) designed to complement classroom instruction and engage students in online activities , assignments and discussions, examinations, wikies that allow for deeper participation inside and outside the classroom.

MICRO ELECTRO CHEMICAL DISCHARGE MACHINE (µECDM) Electro Chemical Discharge Machining (ECDM) has been developed as a hybrid machining process to machine electrically non-conducting and conducting materials effectively and efficiently. The material removal is mainly carried out with melting and vaporisation under thermal energy from spark generated from tool electrode and partially by chemical etching under the presence of an electrolyte. In this process basic principles of EDM and ECM are combined to overcome the limitations of the individual process. The EDM and ECM can machine only conducting materials whereas ECDM can machine both conducting and non-conducting materials effectively and efficiently. Commonly machined materials in ECDM include ceramic, composites, semi conducting materials like silicon to higher level of accuracy. Objectives To measure characteristics of the micro hole machined in terms of Material Removal Rate, Tool Wear Rate and Radial overcut. Also characterization of micro channels. Outcome ECDM process has shown good machining tool for drilling of glass substrates stainless steel materials, composites and ceramics. Fabrication of intricate micro features, precise dies deep hole drilling , dressing of micro tools in grinding etc. In the course of Micro and Nano Manufacturing for S8 ME, the same instrument can be preferred. The video demonstration of Micro Electro Chemical Discharge Machine (µECDM) is uploaded in YouTube (a link is provided in the college website). MICRO ELECTRO DISCHARGE MACHINE The EDM process involves a controlled erosion of electrically conductive materials by the initiation of rapid and repetitive spark discharge between the electrode tool and work piece separated by a small gap of about 0.01-0.50 mm known as spark gap. The spark gap is either flooded or immersed under the dielectric fluid. The spark discharge is produced by the controlled pulsing of direct current between the work piece and tool. Micro EDM and EDM are similar in principles, and difference occurs in terms of the energy range and tool which is lower. The resolution of axis movement and discharge energy are in micron ranges for micro EDM process. Micro EDM is shown as an effective tool in machining extremely hard materials hard tungsten carbide and alloys of steel. Objectives To measure characteristics of the micro hole machine in terms of Material Removal Rate, Tool Wear Rate and Radial overcut. Also characterization of micro channels. Outcome Micro EDM has been used as an effective tool in fabricating micro electrode, gear patterns with Tungsten Carbide materials, micro compressor, micro turbine impellers , high aspect ratio micro arrays, biocompatible devices from Magnesium etc. In the course of Micro and Nano Manufacturing for S8 ME, the same instrument can be preferred. The video demonstration of Micro Electro Discharge Machine is uploaded in YouTube (a link is provided in the college website). MICRO ABRASIVE JET MACHINE Abrasive Jet Machining (AJM) has become an effective tool for machining hard brittle materials with high intensity flow of abrasive particles. The size of abrasive decides the accuracy of the process and fine abrasives are used for finishing operations. In AJM material is removed with kinetic energy of loose abrasives from workpiece. The commonly used medium is air. Abrasive mixture is directed through nozzle to workpiece. The tip of nozzle and workpiece should be kept within a small gap. The distance between nozzle and workpiece, diameter of nozzle and angle of impact influence the machining process. As the jet strikes on the surface micro plastic deformation happens on the workpiece and on further impact the material get eroded by chipping action. The brittle broken particles getting separated on the surface of the workpiece are taken away by the carrier gas. Objectives To measure the Material Removal Rate and Radial Overcut for a machined hole under given set of parameters. Outcome The AJM has found process application in cleaning, etching, cutting, deburring and polishing on of ceramic materials which are brittle in nature and is much cheaper than tradition wet etching processes. Micro fabrication of channels and holes on PMM areas is also carried out . AJM is also as an effective tool in microelectronic, optoelectronic devices and 3D structures on glass. In the course of Micro and Nano Manufacturing for S8 ME, the same instrument can be preferred. The video demonstration of Micro Abrasive Jet Machine is uploaded in YouTube (a link is provided in the college website). HOT AIR JET MACHINE In hot air jet machining, the hot air jet issuing from a nozzle is impinged on the glass plate to be cut. The hot air jet or the X-Y coordinate table, on which the plate glass is placed, can be moved at the required speed. Any complex profile could be easily and economically generated in a single step by this method. A hot air jet is produced by using (a) a glass tube, (b) a compact hot air gun and (c) an electronic hot Air blower. In the preliminary experiments, a glass tube and a compact hot air gun are used. The compressed air is passed through the inlet passage and a hot air jet is obtained at the nozzle exit. The nozzles of different diameters are fitted (one at a time) at the outlet of the gun by varying the jet diameter. The required air flow rates and velocities are obtained by varying the supply air pressure on the system terminals. The air temperature is adjusted by adjusting the voltage supply to the electric coil with the help of a dimmer stat. The glass tube used for producing the jet can with- stand temperatures up to 400°C. Objectives To machine the glass workpiece in required profile using hot air from hot air jet machine Outcome Student will be provided an innovative method for machining of glass with hot air, which is a non-conventional machining process. The method can be used for machining of micro channels and micro features on glass workpieces. In the course of Micro and Nano Manufacturing for S8 ME, the same instrument can be preferred. The video demonstration of Hot Air Jet Machine is uploaded in YouTube (a link is provided in the college website). POSTER PRESENTATION OF MICHELSON INTERFEROMETRY A simple Michelson interferometry, a non-intrusive technique, is aligned to detect the temperature distribution. Interferometric measurement of temperature utilizes the refractive index variations in a medium due to temperature dependent density distributions. Temperature distribution measurement of a candle flame is measured by Michelson Interferometer at Mechanical measurement lab of SJCET Palai. This poster is demonstrated in department website. Objectives To measure the temperature distribution in a flow field using non-intrusive technique. Laser interferometric measurement by Michelson interferometry is used to capture the fringes in the flow field. Outcome For small flow field like heat sinks, heat dissipating devices flame,heater, the intrusive techniques such as thermocouple intrusion is disturbing the flow field while taking the measurements. This non-intrusive technique is not disturbing the flow field while taking the measurements. So that the accurate values/measurements are obtained. In the course of compressible flow for S7 ME the same measurement technique is mentioned. POSTER PRESENTATION OF CYLINDRICAL HEAT PIPES Heat pipes are basic gadgets which are utilized to exchange heat starting from one area to the next, utilizing an evaporation-condensation cycle. Heat pipes are alluded to as the “superconductors” of heat because of their quick heat exchange capability with low heat loss. A poster presentation of cylindrical heat pipe is demonstrated in department website. Objectives • To determine the thermal characteristics of cylindrical heat pipes using alumina-water nanofluid. • To determine the temperature distribution across the heat pipe. Outcomes Heat pipes can be used to transmit heat over significant distances with extremely negligible temperature drops and no external pumping power. Compared to the conventional heat transfer devices heat pipes are highly efficient with low energy consumption. In the course of heat and mass transfer for S6 ME , the introduction to heat pipes is explained. So this presentation will help to get an exposure in the heat pipe technology and temperature measurement using data acquisition system.

INITIATIVES BEYOND THE CLASS ROOM Mentor System Each faculty member in the department is assigned the complete responsibility of 30 students. This Faculty Mentor establishes a close relationship with students, orients them to college practices, follows their progress regularly and guides them throughout the four-year course. Employment of this idea has helped several students to solve the problems they face in the academics. Also this method helps the parents to keep track of their child and their academic performance. Remedial Education The students with backlogs have a heavy load as they must take exams simultaneously for both the new semester’s subjects as well as for the subjects they fail; and they cannot attend classes in the subjects they have failed. Thus, they do not get any additional teaching in the subjects in which they are weak unless they resort to coaching classes or other private means. This may in turn result in cumulative failures, leading some students to take more years to complete the four-year engineering course. To help our students from such situations, remedial classes are provided by the AI & DS department during the month before the repeat exams, enabling the students to face the difficult papers with greater confidence and ease. Placement Training Department offers intense placement training on regular basis.

Counsellors are not the same as doctors and psychiatrists, and cannot prescribe medication. Counselling is not about giving advice, but can help you understand difficulties. Your counsellor can work with you to help you make decisions and changes that may work better for you. Counseling by experts are available in SJCET for students having problems with their studies and personal habits. Sr. Theresia Joice Varghese (M.Sc.

George, DMSP, MA(psy.)Ph.D., FIACP (Consultant Clinical Psychologist) Ms. Mathew Henah Binny (Counseling Psychologist) The methodology followed in SJCET for the student Counseling is unique and fruitful since very many years. We do have follow-up sessions in needed cases and it is up to the discretion of the counselor. As a result we see some noticeable changes in the behavior of our students and their confidence level and their ability to work hard has increased considerably. “If you fail, never give up because F.A.I.L. means “first Attempt In Learning” End is not the end, if fact E.N.D. means “Effort Never Dies” If you get No as an answer, remember N.O. means “Next Opportunity”.

Audio-Visual aid Audio-visual methods for teaching are always more effective over conventional teaching methods. There is an LED/LCD screen which plays videos on topics related to electrical machines and electronics devices. The labs are displayed with various charts on eminent personalities in the electrical field. Construction of various equipment and their principle of operation have been explained in other charts. These methods provide a better means to engross the students. The teaching and learning process is made efficacious through animated power point presentation (ppt). Certain complex topics are made easier to understand through animation option available in ppt. This not only increases the attentiveness of the students but also makes the teaching and learning process easier. Case-studies and group discussion on relevant topics especially during non-credit courses also inculcates soft skills in students. Peer group teaching-learning method is adopted where a student teaches a topic to three or four students assigned to him/her. This method is beneficial and engaging during the revisions after a topic or a module. Virtual labs We also utilize virtual lab facility which is an initiative of Ministry of Education under the National Mission on education through ICT. These simulation-based labs facilitate the students to test and understand the experiments at their own pace and convenient time. e-learning resources Students are encouraged to utilize the E-learning resources through NPTEL courses, e- books, e-journals to further enhance their knowledge. Faculty members provide them information on NPTEL courses available online related to their stream. The college library also has the provisions to refer e-books and e-journals. Students can access more than 15 000 e-books and over 4000 e-journals hosted by science direct and IEEE which available through the main library through institutional login. Apart from this, the students are intimated on webinars, online workshops on various technical and non-technical subjects which gives then the opportunity to add to their skills and expertise. Learning Management System and etlab LMS moodle is an open source and free to download Leaning Management System. It is a platform that empowers the teaching and learning process. Faculties upload their notes, ppt slides, lecture videos and previous university questions on their webpages which can be accessed by the students. One of the quickest way to check the teaching and learning performance is through quizzes. The urge to answer the objective type questions set up by the faculty makes them re-visit the topics. The LMS moodle was used extensively during the Covid-19 pandemic. Etlab is a web application that provides online services to students and faculty members. Class materials can be uploaded by faculty and course attainment can be analysed instantly after a test or assignment. Though LMS moodle is still used for submission of assignments, project report and accessing lab experiment details, most of the work has been shifted to etlab. Remedial classes Remedial hours are part of the timetable where weaker students are given coaching on core/difficult courses. Apart from this special coaching class for previous year students before their supplementary exam is provided. These extra classes are arranged during the study leave.

Read More… INNOVATION CLUB For all students in SJCET, who are interested in innovation & entrepreneurship the Innovation Club is the place to meet like-minded people with complementary skills. Here the students can get inspiration, exchange experiences, build a powerful network and form teams that work on game-changing ideas, because this club has the necessary skills and resources to support the students. INITIATIVES BEYOND THE CLASS ROOM Mentor System Each faculty member in the department is assigned the complete responsibility of 30 students. This Faculty Mentor establishes a close relationship with each student, orients them to college practices, follows their progress regularly and guides them throughout the four-year course. Employment of this idea has helped several students to solve the problems they face in the academics. Also this method helps the parents to keep track of their child and their academic performance. Remedial Education The students with backlogs have a heavy load as they must take exams simultaneously for both the new semester’s subjects as well as for the subjects they fail; and they cannot attend classes in the subjects they have failed. Thus, they do not get any additional teaching in the subjects in which they are weak unless they resort to coaching classes or other private means. This may in turn result in cumulative failures, leading some students to take more years to complete the four-year engineering course. To help our students from such situations, remedial classes are provided by the ECE department during the month before the repeat exams, enabling the students to face the difficult papers with greater confidence and ease Gate Coaching The department offers evening classes for students preparing for GATE, to help them understand the GATE pattern and solve GATE papers.

Together, AI and DS comprise a new interdisciplinary field that draws on various domains, such as engineering science, statistics, cognitive science, computing, health science, and information science. Students in this field learn how to design and implement AI and DS-based solutions for engineering and business problems, including machine learning, data visualization, semantic web and social network analytics, blockchain technologies, and data security and privacy. Big data solutions have changed the way in which business models are built and run. This program is ideal for those looking to develop intelligent engineering systems and business solutions in the age of big data. Result 2023-24 Odd Semester PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS THE INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS (IEEE) IEEE opens the door to opportunities that will help students to develop their professional identity in IEEE’s designated fields of interest: sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). In addition to accessing a range of membership benefits, students will make global connections with people who can help students along their targeted career path through IEEE’s international community of members and volunteers. ADSA (Artificial intelligence and Data Science Students Association) The Department of Artificial intelligence and Data has science is a newly involved department of this Institution. Education is simply the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another. Commemorating the quote of a famous American civil rights activist, “A word as to the education of the heart, we don’t believe that this can be imparted through books, it can only be imparted through the loving touch of the teacher”, ADSA was proposed with the objective to organize various activities that consists of drawing the goodness and best out of our own students under the guidance of the well trained faculty members of the department. INITIATIVES BEYOND THE CLASS ROOM Mentor System Each faculty member in the department is assigned the complete responsibility of 30 students. This Faculty Mentor establishes a close relationship with students, orients them to college practices, follows their progress regularly and guides them throughout the four-year course. Employment of this idea has helped several students to solve the problems they face in the academics. Also this method helps the parents to keep track of their child and their academic performance. Remedial Education The students with backlogs have a heavy load as they must take exams simultaneously for both the new semester’s subjects as well as for the subjects they fail; and they cannot attend classes in the subjects they have failed. Thus, they do not get any additional teaching in the subjects in which they are weak unless they resort to coaching classes or other private means. This may in turn result in cumulative failures, leading some students to take more years to complete the four-year engineering course. To help our students from such situations, remedial classes are provided by the AI & DS department during the month before the repeat exams, enabling the students to face the difficult papers with greater confidence and ease. Placement Training Placement training is an integral part of the department’s curriculum in the college, aimed at preparing Artificial Intelligence and Data Science students for the competitive job market. The AD department organizes comprehensive workshops and seminars to enhance students’ employability skills. These sessions cover various aspects such as resume writing, interview techniques, and professional etiquette. The college also invites industry experts and professionals to conduct mock interviews and provide valuable feedback to students. Additionally, the department facilitates internships and industry collaborations to expose students to real-world scenarios and foster practical knowledge. The ultimate goal of placement training is to ensure that students are well-equipped and confident to secure lucrative job opportunities upon graduation.
